# twitch-ws
This is a simple application designed to relay twitch websocket information to all connected clients in a standard manner.

I wrote this because I've been utilizing the twitch websockets more in some personal projects, but having to port all the twitch connection logic into my different apps that are written in different languages is tedious. This allows me to have a single point of entry that has a standard I know about and can maintain if necessary.
